Although he inherited the position of firefighter constable, he couldn’t give up his dream of becoming a painter and sought to study under Utagawa Toyokuni I. However, since the studio was full of students, he was not accepted and instead became a disciple of Utagawa Toyohiro, taking one character each from his master’s name and his own to become Utagawa Hiroshige. Initially, he painted actor portraits, beauties, and book illustrations, but after his master passed away in 1828 (Bunsei 11), he began focusing on landscapes. In 1832 (Tenpō 3), he passed on the position of firefighter constable to the inheritor and devoted himself entirely to painting. The following year, he published “The Fifty-three Stations of the Tōkaidō,” which established his reputation as a landscape artist. In 1856 (Ansei 3), he began creating “One Hundred Famous Views of Edo,” which he completed in 1858 (Ansei 5). In the same year, he died from a cholera outbreak in Edo. It is said that he left behind around 20,000 works, including book illustrations, fans, and board games like sugoroku.","true"

Like the first Hiroshige, he was the son of a fire warden. He inherited his master’s style and painted landscapes and bijin-ga (pictures of beautiful women). After the death of the first Hiroshige in 1858 (Ansei 5), he married Otatsu, who was the adopted daughter, and took on the name of the second Hiroshige. However, he later divorced and moved to Yokohama, where he called himself Kisei Risshō and worked on Yokohama-e (pictures of Yokohama) and woodblock prints attached to export tea boxes. Besides “Akasaka Kiribatake Uchū Seikei” in the series “One Hundred Famous Views of Edo,” three works, “Ichigaya Hachiman,” “Ueno Yamashita,” and “Bikunibashi Sechū,” are believed to be his creations.","false"

He became a disciple of the first-generation Utagawa Toyokuni. As the saying goes, “Toyokuni for portraits, Kuniyoshi for warriors, Hiroshige for scenic places,” he gained fame for his bijin-ga (pictures of beautiful women) and yakusha-e (actor prints). In 1844, he inherited the name Toyokuni and called himself Toyokuni II, but since his fellow disciple Toyoshige had already taken the name, he is generally referred to as Toyokuni III. His succession to the name sparked controversy, and his rivalry with his junior disciple Utagawa Kuniyoshi made him a figure of mixed reputation. Later, through the mediation of the first-generation Hiroshige, tensions with Utagawa Toyoshige were resolved, and collaborative works by the three artists were produced. He had a long life and is said to have produced over 10,000 works, making him one of the most prolific ukiyo-e artists.","true"

At the age of 15, he came of age and entered the service of the Edo residence of the Hojo domain in Awa Province. However, he was dismissed and became a ronin due to quarrels and slander. He aspired to become a kyogen writer, but abandoned this ambition due to the death of his parents. He became a boarder with Kikugawa Eizan, who was popular for his bijin-ga (pictures of beautiful women), and became an artist. He also studied painting under Katsushika Hokusai, who lived nearby. While inheriting his master’s delicate bijin-ga style, his own style gradually became more decadent, which gained popularity. Although Eisen is synonymous with bijin-ga and shunga (erotic art), he is also known for his meisho-e (pictures of famous places), such as “The Sixty-nine Stations of the Kiso Kaido.” He was a libertine who loved alcohol and women, and even ran a brothel in Nezu’s red-light district.","true"
